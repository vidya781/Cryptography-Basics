N = { 1,2,3,4,5....} Set of positive integers

Z = { 0,+/- 1,+/-2,+/-3,......} Set of integers

The rational numbers are denoted by Q and the real numbers by R

N ⊂ Z ⊂ Q ⊂ R ( Natural numbers, Integers, Rational numbers, Real numbers )

We use the following rules :

If a X b = 0, => a = 0 or b = 0 , a or b = 0

Real Numbers can be compared : 1 < √2 < 2 

α ≥ β or α < β

A set M of real numbers is called bounded from below if there is real number γ such that all elements of M are greater than
this γ. We say that M is bounded from below by γ. 

From below, the set of positive integers is bounded from below by 0, but the set of even integers is not bounded from below.

An important property of the integers is the fact that every set of integers that is bounded from below contains a smallest 
element. Likewise, every set of integers that is bounded from above contains a greatest element. 

For any real number we write : [α]=max⁡{b ∈Z:b≤ α} , hence [α] is the greatest integer, which is less than or equal to α
And this number exists because the set {b ∈Z:b≤ α} is bounded from above.

[ 3.43 ] = 3 and [-3.43] = -4

Finally, we need induction. If a statement, which depends on a positive integer n is true for n = 1 and if the truth for any
integer m with 1 <= m <= n ( or just n) ==> the truth for n + 1, then the statement is true for any positive integer n.
